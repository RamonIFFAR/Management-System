# Management-System
An open-source, web-based management system made as an enhanced version of a school project.

This project was developed with the intention of putting in practice our knowledge of web-based system development and general software development and programming, but, if you wish to use it, you are free to do so under it's license.

If you, for some reason, really wishes to see the original version of the system this one was based on, feel free to check it out in: https://github.com/RamonIFFAR/PPI.
